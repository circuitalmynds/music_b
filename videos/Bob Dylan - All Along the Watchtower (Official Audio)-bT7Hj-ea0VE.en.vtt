00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:18.985
There must be some way
out of here

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:22.188
Said the joker to the thief

00:00:23.623 --> 00:00:26.026
There's too much confusion

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:29.629
I can't get no relief

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:34.434
Businessmen, they drink my wine

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.437
Plowmen dig my earth

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:42.175
None of them along the line

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:44.911
Know what any of it is worth

00:01:00.994 --> 00:01:03.530
No reason to get excited

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:07.400
The thief he kindly spoke

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.837
There are many here among us

00:01:11.638 --> 00:01:14.841
Who feel that life is but a joke

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.478
But you and I, we've been
through that

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.115
And this is not our fate

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.352
So let us not talk falsely now

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.689
The hour is getting late

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:48.074
All along the watchtower

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:51.411
Princes kept the view

00:01:52.812 --> 00:01:55.815
While all the women
came and went

00:01:56.483 --> 00:01:58.718
Barefoot servants, too

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:03.022
Outside in the distance

00:02:03.857 --> 00:02:06.693
A wildcat did growl

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:10.196
Two riders were approaching

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:14.467
The wind began to howl
