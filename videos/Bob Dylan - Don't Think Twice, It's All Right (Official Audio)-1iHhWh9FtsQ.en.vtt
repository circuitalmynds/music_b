00:00:08.942 --> 00:00:12.779
Well it ain't no use to sit
and wonder why, babe

00:00:14.447 --> 00:00:16.750
Ifin' you don't know by now

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:21.855
An' it ain't no use to sit
and wonder why, babe

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.492
It'll never do some how

00:00:26.793 --> 00:00:31.998
When your rooster crows
at the break a dawn

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:35.668
Look out your window
and I'll be gone

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:40.240
You're the reason
I'm trav'lin' on

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.543
Don't think twice,
it's all right

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:59.559
And it ain't no use in a-turnin'
on your light, babe

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:03.563
The light I never knowed

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:08.301
An' it ain't no use in turnin'
on your light, babe

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.072
I'm on the dark side of the road

00:01:13.106 --> 00:01:17.677
But I wish there was somethin'
you would do or say

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:21.448
To try and make me change
my mind and stay

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:25.919
We never did too much
talkin' anyway

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:29.456
But don't think twice,
it's all right

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.002
No it ain't no use in callin'
out my name, gal

00:01:44.604 --> 00:01:46.606
Like you never done before

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:51.811
And it ain't no use in callin'
out my name, gal

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.148
I can't hear ya any more

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.187
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin'
wallkin' way down the road

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:05.625
I once loved a woman,
a child I am told

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:09.395
I give her my heart
but she wanted my soul

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:12.799
But don't think twice,
it's all right

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.649
So long honey babe

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.920
Where I'm bound, I can't tell

00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:38.925
Goodbye is too good a word, babe

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:42.529
So I just say fare thee well

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.268
I ain't sayin'
you treated me unkind

00:02:48.268 --> 00:02:52.772
You could have done better
but I don't mind

00:02:52.772 --> 00:02:56.743
You just kinda wasted
my precious time

00:02:56.743 --> 00:02:59.979
But don't think twice,
it's all right
