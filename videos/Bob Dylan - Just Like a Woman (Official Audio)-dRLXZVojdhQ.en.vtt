00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.385
Nobody feels any pain

00:00:20.387 --> 00:00:24.591
Tonight as I stand
inside the rain

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:32.432
Ev'rybody knows
That Baby's got new clothes

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:38.338
But lately I see her
ribbons and her bows

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:43.576
Have fallen from her curls

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:51.584
She takes just like a woman,
yes, she does

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:57.724
She makes love just like
a woman, yes, she does

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:02.495
And she aches just like a woman

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:08.635
But she breaks just
like a little girl

00:01:14.507 --> 00:01:19.746
Queen Mary She's my friend

00:01:21.414 --> 00:01:25.852
Yes, I believe
I'll go see her again

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:33.626
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can't be blessed

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:40.400
Till she sees finally that
she's like all the rest

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.405
With her fog, her amphetamine
and her pearls

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:52.879
She takes just like a woman, yes

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:59.219
She makes love just like
a woman, yes, she does

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.224
And she aches just like a woman

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:10.230
But she breaks just
like a little girl

00:02:15.735 --> 00:02:21.908
It was raining from the first
And I was dying there of thirst

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:24.611
So I came in here

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:31.518
And your long-time curse hurts

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:36.456
But what's worse
Is this pain in here

00:02:38.258 --> 00:02:39.859
I can't stay in here

00:02:41.027 --> 00:02:48.434
Ain't it clear that
I just can't fit

00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:54.440
Yes, I believe it's time
for us to quit

00:02:56.442 --> 00:03:01.981
But when we meet again
Introduced as friends

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:08.755
Please don't let on that
you knew me when

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:13.459
I was hungry and
it was your world

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.167
Ah, you fake just like
a woman, yes, you do

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:27.207
You make love just like
a woman, yes, you do

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:31.678
Then you ache just like a woman

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:38.318
But you break just
like a little girl
