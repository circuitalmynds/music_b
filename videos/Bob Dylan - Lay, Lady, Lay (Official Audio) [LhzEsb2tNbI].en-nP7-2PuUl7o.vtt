00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.648
Lay lady lay

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:20.620
Lay across my big brass bed

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.228
Lay lady lay

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:33.433
Lay across my big brass bed

00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:44.077
Whatever colors you have
in your mind

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:49.716
I show them to you
and you see them shine

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:53.153
Lay lady lay

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:57.557
Lay across my big brass bed

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:04.998
Stay lady stay

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:08.935
Stay with your man a while

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.777
Until the break of day

00:01:18.778 --> 00:01:21.514
Let me see you make him smile

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:32.859
His clothes are dirty but his,
his hands are clean

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:39.032
And you are the best thing
that he's ever seen

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.001
Stay lady stay

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:46.039
Stay with your man a while

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:56.950
Why wait any longer for
the world to begin

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.454
You can have your cake
and eat it too

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:08.862
Why wait any longer for
the one you love

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.767
When he's standing
in front of you

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.571
Lay lady lay

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.243
Lay across my big brass bed

00:02:29.415 --> 00:02:30.750
Stay lady stay

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:35.889
Stay while the night is
still ahead

00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:45.865
I long to see you
in the morning light

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:51.905
I long to reach for you
in the night

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.375
Stay lady stay

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.013
Stay while the night
is still ahead
