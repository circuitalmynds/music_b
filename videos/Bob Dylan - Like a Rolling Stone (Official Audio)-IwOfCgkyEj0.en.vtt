00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:14.114
Once upon a time you
dressed so fine

00:00:14.114 --> 00:00:19.219
Threw the bums a dime in your
prime, didn't you?

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:24.491
People call say 'beware doll,
you're bound to fall'

00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:29.029
You thought they were all
kidding you

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:35.702
You used to laugh about

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:40.740
Everybody that was hanging out

00:00:41.608 --> 00:00:44.744
Now you don't talk so loud

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:49.582
Now you don't seem so proud

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:53.219
About having to be scrounging

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:59.426
your next meal

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:01.428
How does it feel,

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.399
how does it feel?

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:11.438
To be without a home

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.409
Like a complete unknown,

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:21.414
like a rolling stone

00:01:32.258 --> 00:01:36.563
Ahh you've gone to the finest
schools, alright Miss Lonely

00:01:36.563 --> 00:01:40.733
But you know you only used to
get juiced in it

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:46.306
Nobody's ever taught you how
to live out on the street

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:50.710
And now you're gonna have to get
used to it

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:57.484
You say you never compromise

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:02.455
With the mystery tramp,
but now you realize

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:07.360
He's not selling any alibis

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:11.898
As you stare into the vacuum
of his eyes

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:15.568
And say do you want to

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.875
make a deal?

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.710
How does it feel,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.882
how does it feel?

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:33.620
To be on your own,

00:02:36.256 --> 00:02:38.625
with no direction home

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.696
A complete unknown,

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:48.701
like a rolling stone

00:02:59.445 --> 00:03:03.216
Ah you never turned around to
see the frowns

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:08.454
On the jugglers and the clowns
when they all did tricks for you

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:12.825
You never understood that it
ain't no good

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:17.897
You shouldn't let other people
get your kicks for you

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.904
You used to ride on a chrome
horse with your diplomat

00:03:26.005 --> 00:03:29.943
Who carried on his shoulder
a Siamese cat

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:34.347
Ain't it hard when you
discovered that

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:39.419
He really wasn't where it's at

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:49.229
After he took from you
everything he could steal

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.064
How does it feel,

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.135
how does it feel?

00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.407
To have on your own,

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.145
with no direction home

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:11.084
Like a complete unknown,

00:04:13.453 --> 00:04:16.122
like a rolling stone

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:31.204
Ahh princess on a steeple and
all the pretty people

00:04:31.204 --> 00:04:35.642
They're all drinking, thinking
that they've got it made

00:04:38.044 --> 00:04:40.480
Exchanging all precious gifts

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.251
But you better take
your diamond ring,
you better pawn it babe

00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:52.692
You used to be so amused

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:57.530
At Napoleon in rags and
the language that he used

00:04:58.197 --> 00:05:01.701
Go to him he calls you,
you can't refuse

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:07.140
When you ain't got nothing,
you got nothing to lose

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:16.215
You're invisible now,
you've got no secrets to conceal

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.251
How does it feel,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.222
ah, how does it feel?

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.194
To be on your own,

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:33.433
with no direction home

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.604
Like a complete unknown,

00:05:40.773 --> 00:05:43.609
like a rolling stone
