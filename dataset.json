I let this song be my carryout song at our school for a special occasion back in the day and I got myself my first girlfriend! :)\n\n\"She's Got a Way\" is a song by Billy Joel. The original version is on the 1971 album Cold Spring Harbor, while the remade live version was released as a single from the 1981 album Songs in the Attic and peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in early 1982[1].\n\nAfter its original recording, Joel no longer appreciated the song as much as he originally had. In an interview, he \"thought [it] was a cornball for years. I had trouble singing it at first. Then I got into it and decided everybody has a corny side, I suppose.\n\nCharts  Peak\nposition\nU.S. Billboard Hot 100  23\nU.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary  4\n\nIn other news, I have added other lyrics to this song so you can sing along, or perhaps learn the song!
